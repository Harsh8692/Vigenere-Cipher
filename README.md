# Vigenere-Cipher
CS425 - Algebraic Coding Theory &amp; Cryptology: Vigenère Cipher Attack(Assignment)

This repository contains an implementation of an attack on the Vigenère Cipher using Kasiski's examination. The implementation is provided in a single C file named `assignment.c`. The repository includes a sample ciphertext in `ciphertext.txt` and the resulting decrypted output in `output.txt`.

## Files

- `assignment.c`: The main C file containing the implementation of the Vigenère Cipher attack using Kasiski's examination.
- `ciphertext.txt`: The input file containing the cipher text to be decrypted.
- `output.txt`: The output file generated after running `assignment.c`, containing the decrypted plaintext.
